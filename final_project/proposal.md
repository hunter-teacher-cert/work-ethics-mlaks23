# Final Project Proposal
## Alex Moore and Marisa Laks

### Topic:  Partisan Gerrymandering:  Can Algorithms Solve a Problem Exacerbated by Other Algorithms?

#### Sources:
* https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/12/1031567/mathematicians-algorithms-stop-gerrymandering/
* https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/gerrymandering-explained

#### Overview of gerrymandering:
* Gerrymandering is the process of redrawing districts in order to influence elections.
* The U.S. Supreme Court found gerrymandering should not be controlled by the Judicial Branch.  Several local courts have stricken down gerrymandering as a result of analysis by modern algorithms, however.
* This redistricting is widespread.
* It is often done by algorithm by both Democrats and Republic to keep and gain political power.

#### Why it should be addressed:
* Some have argued that redistricting to favor incumbents and strategically advance parties minimizes the impact of any one citizen to impact a democratic election.

#### Possible solutions:
These are program-based examples illustrating the problem and addressing solutions:  
* Example to counter gerrymandering: https://github.com/alarm-redist/redist/  
* The industry standard gerrymandering software made by Caliper https://www.caliper.com/redistricting/online_redistricting.htm

#### GUIDING GOAL:
We could leave our classmates with specific information - ideally actual code - relating to the algorithms that are designed to identify gerrymandering along with explanatory comments.

#### DELIVERABLE:  
We could make our slide deck into a PDF.
Notes on the code aspect:

#### Code Component:
It would be great if we could obtain and understand some of the anti-gerrymandering code and work with that.  Some of the redist anti-gerrymandering code on Git Hub, and it looks like some of it is written in r.  It could be fun to learn a little r and try to work through that.
