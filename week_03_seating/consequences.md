The article is talking about optimization in general, but gives examples where there were unintended consequences of the optimization. They discuss how the desire for optimization is a mindset developed early on by software engineers. The people or company optimizing their program makes decisions about what values are important. According to the article, "[A small group of people's] vision and their values about technology are remaking our individual lives and societies. As a result, the problems with the optimization mindset have become our problems, too."

A specific example of unintended consequences of optimization references a 2016 memo from Facebook (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data). In the memo, the employee states Facebook's goal of connecting more people is so important that it outweighs the negative ways in which people use Facebook and that Facebook is aware of this. The push to connect people "comes with potential violations of user privacy, greater circulation of hate speech and misinformation, [and] political polarization."
